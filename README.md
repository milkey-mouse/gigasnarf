**ðŸš§ Work in progress! ðŸš§**

Gigasnarf automatically stores a copy of everything you see on the web by monitoring and interpreting the network traffic from either a single computer or an entire network.
It does not insert itself as a proxy, modify any traffic, or intercept encrypted data streams like some systems; instead, it [politely asks](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/TLS#tls-decryption:~:text=The%20key%20log%20file%20is%20a%20text%20file%20generated%20by%20applications%20such%20as%20Firefox%2C%20Chrome%20and%20curl%20when%20the%20SSLKEYLOGFILE%20environment%20variable%20is%20set.) browsers and other applications for their private keys and passively reconstructs HTTP(S) exchanges from their network traffic.
This approach is less problematic than [adding a proxy that decrypts and re-encrypts network traffic between you and the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) because you don't have to configure your computer to trust an additional certificateâ€”which, in any context, should raise some eyebrowsâ€”or change how encrypted sessions are negotiated at all (some proxies are [more easily tricked](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_comments/2016/09/00019-129028.pdf) into accepting invalid certificates than the browsers behind them, weakening security).
